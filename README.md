Make Microsoft Teams Status Online

# method
Simulate key press and release to keep you online,
but key press may cause some problems, so we choose press cap_lock and reset cap_lock very quickly.
you can keep this code running all the time and keep writing/reading/searching the Internet.
When you want to stop, just use Ctrl+C CMD to stop.
